# TODO list

## Potential App improvements

- Being able to add/remove cards one by one
- Being able to bulk add cards via copy-paste
  of text
- Ability to not only have texts, but images
  as cards
- Ability to specify width of cards
- Ability to specify url (or generate) so as to
  spread the 'board' to others for collaboration

## Potential Code/Development ux improvements

- Continuously: fix one of the TODOs in code
- CardState maybe not needed at all?
- Write some unit tests just so we can learn the
  syntax
- Learning about regression testing elm applications
  would be great (elm-program-test is popular)
- Parcel is supposedly more cross platform than
  elm-live (which has some issues in Windows?) so
  would improve the mobs hot-reloading experience
- Refactor Model from Main.elm into Model.elm.

## Bugs

- The order of cards changes when picking up a card.
  Can be seen when two cards are stacked on each other
  and the third card is selected.
